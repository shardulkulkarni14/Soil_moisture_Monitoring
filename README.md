# Soil_Moisture_Monitoring

### Abstract
Agriculture is considered as one of the oldest and most important of all the economic activities 
of man which contributes a lot to the financial of India. To get quality product, appropriate 
irrigation has to be done and to monitor these irrigation and agricultural activities modern 
technology of the Internet of Things is being used in today's life. Integral part of plant life is 
soil moisture which directly affects crop growth and yield, as well as irrigation scheduling. 
This system will be a substitute to conventional farming methods. We will develop such a 
system that will help a farmer to know his field status by sitting at his remote place and 
appropriate measures will be taken. As we know that IoT is emerging in our day-to-day life. 
The agriculture field should take advantage of IoT, for instance IoT provides the cloud platform 
called "ThingSpeak". ThingSpeak is an IoT analytics platform service that allows us to 
aggregate, visualize, and analyse live data streams collected in the cloud.
The main purpose of this project is to increase the agricultural yield with least of the human 
intervention. The soil moisture sensor detects the moisture level in the soil and irrigates the 
crop in a controlled manner. If there is any variation in moisture level then the sensor will 
update the observed value and store it in the cloud. The sensor readings will be used to open 
the valve and supply a required amount of irrigational facilities to particular sensed areas.
In order to showcase the sensed data to the farmers we are providing a web application 
(website) which the farmers can use by sitting at their remote place. Farmers can login to this 
website using his mobile device and see the status of his farm. By seeing the visualized data 
on the website, the farmer can analyse his yield and condition of the land with respect to 
previous year
